# 🌾 AgriSec

## Offline AI Agricultural Assistant for African Farmers

AgriSec is an AI-powered offline agricultural assistant developed for the **Africa Deep Tech Challenge (ADTC) 2026**. It helps farmers access practical agricultural knowledge without requiring an internet connection.

The system combines **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **Ollama**, **Qwen2.5**, **FAISS**, and a multilingual agricultural knowledge base to answer farming questions in **English** and **Hausa** while running completely on a standard laptop.

# 🚜 The Problem

Millions of farmers across Africa have limited access to agricultural extension services.

Many rural communities experience:

* Poor or no internet connectivity
* Limited access to agricultural experts
* Language barriers
* Difficulty accessing reliable farming information

Most AI assistants depend on cloud services, making them difficult to use in remote farming communities.

# 💡 Our Solution

AgriSec brings agricultural intelligence completely offline.

Instead of relying on cloud APIs, AgriSec stores agricultural knowledge locally and uses AI to retrieve the most relevant information before generating accurate, source-backed responses.

The system can assist farmers with:

* 🌽 Crop production
* 🌱 Fertilizer recommendations
* 🐛 Pest and disease management
* 🐄 Livestock management
* 🌾 Post-harvest storage
* 🌍 Agricultural best practices
* 🇳🇬 English and Hausa language support

# 🧠 How It Works

1. The farmer asks a question in English or Hausa.
2. AgriSec detects the language.
3. Relevant agricultural documents are retrieved using FAISS.
4. The retrieved knowledge is supplied to the local AI model.
5. The AI generates a grounded response.
6. The system displays the information together with the document sources.

Everything runs locally without any cloud dependency.
